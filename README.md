> This project, while still in development, is moving along much slower than initially anticipated. As this is a "pet project" that had to be prioritized below a handful of other commitments and responsibilities I have, so it has taken a back seat since the initial planning was undertaken almost a year ago. I hope to have the alpha version completed by the end of 2021, but I can't make any promises or commitments to a release date at this point. I apologize for any inconvenience. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please reach out to me at [will.code.for.coffee@outlook.com](mailto:will.code.for.coffee@outlook.com) with "PythonPress" in the subject line. Thank you! -- Dead Bat

# PythonPress

A dynamic content-management system written in Python, inspired by WordPress and SharePoint. PythonPress is still in its early stages and development has slowed considerably due to "life" but this repo will receive updates from time to time. 

## Project Goals

* A fully-functional content management system that is versatile, resilient, and secure.
  * A versatile CMS is adaptable to a variety of purposes and can power any type of website.
  * A resilient CMS is coded for efficiency, handles heavy workloads with ease, and recovers seamlessly when errors do occur.
  * A secure CMS is built with secure components, in a stable and fault-tolerant language, and follows security best practices for web development.
* The database schema should be based on the WordPress database schema.
  * Mimicking the WordPress database schema lays a foundation for future cross-compatibility features.
  * Using a compatible database schema will make it easy to port plugins from WordPress to PythonPress.
  * Eventually, we want to transition from SQL to Microsoft Azure CosmosDB.
